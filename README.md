# VRCFT Package Installer
Editor script to auto install latest Pawlygon Face Tracking template after a unity package is added in a project. 

To use it, just place the Editor folder on your project and modify the const called `patcher_file_name` with a key that contains on your package name, like Lina_**FT_Patcher**_V1.0.0, this is required so the script won't run for other packages imports.

The script can be modified to any other template if it's available on GitHub releases.
